This visa allows its holder to enter and stay in the country as a volunteer or student in religious formation or to carry out theological studies in an institute or organization affiliated with a church or religious denomination duly recognized by the Colombian State.

Remember that the main religion in Colombia is Roman-Catholic, if you are applying under a different church, you need to make sure that this church is officially recognized by the Colombian government. [Here you will find the list](https://www.mininterior.gov.co/registro-publico-de-entidades-religiosas/) of the almost 10,000 churches recognized by the Colombian Government.

The process of obtaining recognition for a religious organization in Colombia typically involves meeting certain legal requirements and going through an application process with the Colombian government. The specific steps and requirements may vary, but generally, the organization would need to submit documentation and information to demonstrate its legitimacy, structure, purpose, and activities.

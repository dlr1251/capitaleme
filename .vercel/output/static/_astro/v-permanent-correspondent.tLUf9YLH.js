Journalists often require a special kind of visa because their work involves reporting on events and gathering information in countries other than their own. These visas, commonly known as journalist visas or press visas, are specifically designed to grant journalists the necessary legal permission to enter a country and perform their professional duties.

They also need to be aware of the country’s media and journalism laws and also the necessary protection to carry out their duties.

The V - Permanent correspondent journalist allows its holder to work in Colombia as a permanent press correspondent for a foreign media outlet.

- Nationals of countries exempt from short-stay visas can stay in the country for up to 180 days in the calendar year (January 1 - December 31).
- Upon entering the country, these foreigners receive an Entry and Stay Permit (PT - Tourism Permit), Integration and Development (PID), or Permit for Other Activities (POA) modalities.
- This permit is stamped in the passport and is commonly referred to as a "tourist visa." However, it should not be confused with the V - Tourism Visa.
- The maximum time given is 90 days each time they enter the national territory. If the foreigner has already stayed in Colombia for more than 90 days during the calendar year - January 1 to December 31 - then the permit will be granted for the remaining time to complete the maximum allowed time of 180 days.
- Migración Colombia may [grant extensions](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_uaemc_2061_2020.htm#16) of stay to foreigners who intend to extend their stay, having used an Entry and Stay Permit (PIP), without exceeding one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days (continuous or discontinuous) within the same calendar year.
- For the granting of any temporary stay permit (PTP) or extension of stay, the foreigner must prove that they have a valid entry and stay permit (PIP).

### **Carry out the process on time**

- The important thing to consider is the application time. It must be made within five (5) business days before the expiration of the Entry and Stay Permit (PIP) granted. If not done within this term, the application will be rejected.
- Every application for a Temporary Stay Permit (PTP) or Stay Extension is recorded at 08:00 hours on the next business day after the application is filed.
1. When the passport, travel document, or identity document of the foreigner has an expiration date shorter than the term allowed for the Stay Extension, this will be granted only up to the day the validity of the travel document presented upon entry into the country ends.
2. The Temporary Stay Permit or Stay Extension will be granted for each (PIP), therefore, the Stay Extension will not proceed when the foreigner has a valid extension.

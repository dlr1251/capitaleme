The Migration Movements Certificate is an official document that certifies the entries and exits from Colombian territory.

This document consists of a table of records with several columns, each entry will contain:

Name and surname of the traveler
Date of the trip
I/E - Referring to whether it is an immigration (I) or entry into the country, or an emigration (E), or exit from the country.
Destination or origin - City to which you are traveling or from where you are coming.
Type of travel document - It is the type of document with which you were identified at the time of going through the migration control process. It can be a Passport, Citizenship ID, Foreign ID, or identity document.
Travel condition: In the case of Colombians, this field is not relevant. In the case of foreigners, it refers to the type of permit or visa through which entry into the country was authorized. Here we will see if the foreigner entered with a tourism permit (PT), other activities (POA), integration and development (PID), Visitor (V), Migrant (M), or Resident (R) visa.
PCM: Refers to the Migration Control Post through which they entered or left the country.
Ordinarily, this certificate reflects the entries and exits from the country for the last 5 years. If records from earlier are required, it is possible, but the procedure must be carried out in person at one of the Service Facilitation Centers - Colombia Migration Offices - in the country.

This document is a necessary requirement to apply for certain visa categories, among others, the Spouse visa, Permanent Partner, Parent of a Colombian National, and the Resident visa for Accumulated Time.

The procedure to obtain the Migration Movements Certificate consists of filling out the Single Procedure Form of Colombia Migration, paying the fees, and once the document is ready, it is sent to Colombian nationals by email, and foreigners must personally go to the Colombia Migration office where the procedure was filed.

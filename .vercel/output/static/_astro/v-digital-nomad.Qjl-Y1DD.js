The Digital Nomad Visa in Colombia is open to any passport holder of one of the short-stay visa exempted countries (like US, Canada, Australia, European Union, Israel, Argentina and many others) who wants to live and work in Colombia remotely. 

This visa is intended for individuals who are self-employed, freelancers, entrepreneurs, or remote workers. Consider that you can apply as an employee, contractor/freelancer, business owner or digital entrepreneur, and each type of application requires different documents to attach to it.

### Short-term visa Exempted countries

USA, Canada, Israel, Australia, Japan, Schengen and Latin American countries are among the short-term visa Exempted countries. You can find the full list [here](https://www.notion.so/Short-term-visa-Exempted-countries-a9e078f19db9473ba66d6a8a430b5c9e?pvs=21).

## What are the benefits and restrictions for this visa?

### **Up to two years validity**

### **This visa admits beneficiaries**

This visa allows you to live and work remotely from Colombia for up to two (2) years. It also allows you to get a foreign ID card (Cédula de extranjería).

Although some people say is valid [only for 6 months, this is not true](https://www.notion.so/The-Digital-Nomad-Visa-Confusion-2a738a2add42437899a341e5d78e0833?pvs=21). TL;DR. It is valid for up to two (2) years, not 180 days as many say.

This visa allows you to bring your Spouse and children as beneficiaries. That is, you can bring your spouse and/or children to live with you, once the main visa is approved.

### **No work permit**

### **No time accrue towards residency**

Please notice that this type of visa does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since it doesn’t have a work permit.

Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, this won’t allow you to add time in order to apply for a residency or (R) visa.

# **How to get it**

As with [any visa application](https://www.notion.so/General-visa-application-rules-1dc2c565143e4adb95086f993f184e36?pvs=21), the process is done online, throuth the Ministry for Foreign Relationship’s website. on this form, other than providing your personal, professional and family information and data, you will be required to attach some documents that are described here below.

## Requirements

In order to apply for this visa, you will need to show evidence of your remote work, a health insurance and financial solvency, which we will explain further below.

**Consider that, according to the current visa Law, all documents produced abroad must be duly apostilled and officially translated by a certified Colombian translator. These documents can’t be more than 90 days old at the time of the visa application.**

### 1. **The photo**

This requirement is one of the most underrated of all, since people tend to leave it for the last minute (showing great cultural adaptation).  This photo is the one that will go on your electronic visa once approved, which is why the authorities require that this photo be:

✅ **Recent, in color and with a white background: *Recent* means that you can’t use your current passport photo or the one from your previous visa. You need to take a new one.**  (if you took this photo yourself from your phone, you can make the background totally white in this [website](https://www.remove.bg/es/upload))

✅ **Neither hair nor accessories shall cover the head or face** (no glasses, no piercings, no necklaces, no earrings)

✅ **The face must be facing the camera and with a neutral expression**

✅ **The head complete and centered**

✅ **Both eyes must be open**

✅ **The size shall not exceed 300 kb**

✅ **3x4cm jpg format.**

[This is an example of how the photo should be. Remember: no accessories.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H54BvMgGknGVHeZGQFZ8OYNEKhsMe8jYKOKU1N5CkO3q8NrZQMAdKyZ7mln-0Kpx-OOXmurwY3qwH1--ioLWGJuHzjGQkIY9jvRYFg59_RU2KDcJVf_r1EFM633i3xCpuVLgw4Cjnhs)

This is an example of how the photo should be. Remember: no accessories.

### 2. **The passport**

You must provide a photocopy of the frontpage (where your personal data is) of your passport, which, as mentioned before, must be from any of the short-term visa Exempted countries. Your passport must be valid for at least six (6) months beyond the date of your visa application. If your passport is only valid for less than six months prior to the date you'll be applying for your visa, you must renew before applying.

If you have two or more passports, you need to apply with the one that you have used for entering the country previously or where you have had previous visas. Some people have used two different passports in the past, however, the Law says that at the Migration control you must inform the officers that circumstance. Notice that this may be deemed as “*inconsistent information*”, which is a common cause of **visas denials.**

### 3. **The entrance stamp, its extension, previous visa or salvoconducto**

If you are applying from Colombia, you must show evidence of your current legal status in the country.

In most cases, this requirement is met by attaching your last Tourism Permit (Entrance Stamp), provided that it won’t expire during the 30 days of the visa processing. If you have extended your stay, you must submit your Tourism Permit Extension as well.

In other cases, you may already have a previous visa such as a student visa, if that is the case, you must attach it. 

In some other cases, if you have overstayed or your current visa is about to expire, you must go to Migración Colombia to get a Salvoconducto for a visa application, and attach it. Remember that there are two types of Salvoconducto: 1. To leave the country and 2. To apply for a visa. The one that you need is the last one.

If you are applying from your home country, you don’t need to attach any of the mentioned documents.

If you are applying from a third country, that is, not Colombia and not your country, you need to attach your residency visa of that third country.

### 4. Evidence of remote work

This requirement can be met in different manners, depending on wether you are applying as a) an employee; b) an independent contractor (freelancer); c) an entrepreneur – founder / owner of a foreign company; or d) as a digital entrepreneur.

- **a) Applying as an employee**
    
    If you are applying as an employee, you need to get ****a letter in Spanish or English, manually signed by your employer (CEO or Legal Representative), indicating your position, type of remuneration you receive per month or per yearm and the. In this letter, it is important to mention that the work you do for the company is done remotely. It is recommended that this letter states your full name and passport number. This letter does not need to be translated nor apostilled.
    
    **If you are an employee and have a contract with said company**, provide it. It is quite common that if you are applying as an employee, they will ask you for this. If the contract is not in Spanish, you'll need to notarize it, apostille it and get an official translation of the document. Not any translation, it must be a translation signed by a Colombian certified translator.
    
- **b) Applying as an independent contractor - freelancer**
    
    Similarly as applying as an employee, you will need a letter from your clients stating the type of work you perform, the remmuneration you receive and that the service is performed remotely. 
    
    To enhance your chances of getting your visa, you can also attach some invoices or bills that you have sent to your clients.
    
    It is common to be required for evidence that your clients actually exist and are operational. This is done by mentioning the website, social media accounts from your clients and, even better, getting the certificate of good standing from the client.
    
- **c) Applying as an entrepreneur – founder / owner of a foreign company**
    
    **If you are an entrepreneur or founder,** and have a company abroad, you will need to demonstrate the existence of such a company with an official document (certificate of incorporation and certificate of good standing). These documents must be duly appostilled and officially translated to Spanish by a certified Colombian translator.
    
- **d) Applying as a digital entrepreneur**
    
    **If you are applying as a digital entrepreneur**, you will need to provide a motivational letter in which you will explain your project and why that project will be of interest for Colombia. You'll also what it consists of, and the financial or human resources you have or intend to have in the future. 
    
    For example, if you are starting a web platform about Colombian tourism, you can mention the hosting plan you are paying for the website, the tech-stack you are using, the domains bought, the market research you have performed, the key contacts, the business model, etc.
    

### 5. A valid **health insurance**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

There are different options to comply with this requirement. Some of the (cheapests) health insurance providers that have the required coverage include: Genki, Terrawind, Mok, Travel Assist, Qualitas assistance and Travelkit.

Your health insurance should cover you for at least one year. According to our experience, the visa authorities are setting the validity of the digital nomad visa based on the coverage period of the health insurance policy. Therefore, we recommend that you obtain a two-year policy if you want your visa to be valid for two years.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme) has the required coverage plus: 1) has 2 years validity by default. 2) Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month.  3) Can be cancelled anytime 4) The purchase is quick and online (one business day at the most) 5) They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in engligh, german, italian…)6) has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

### 6. Personal **bank statements**

Demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to live in the country and cover all your expenses. You will need to provide your bank statements from the three months prior to the visa application. For example, if you are applying for the visa in January, you will need to provide your bank statements for December, November, and October. They can be in english, no need to translate them, but if they are in other language, you must translate them.

Those statements must show that you earn at least three Colombian minimum wages. As of 2023, the Colombian minimum wage is $1,300,000 COP or $722.31 USD (as for - feb. 27 - 2023 exchange rate. Beware of peso volatility!). You don’t need the full transactions list, if you can get a summary or balance from each month, that would be enough.

## Costs

The total costs vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the applicant. For example, if you have not bought your health insurance and need to buy one for your visa application, and other associated costs such as apostilles,  translations, etc.

The government fees can be found in the [Ministry of Foreign Relationships website](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/visa/costos-medios-pago-oficinas-atencion).

| Visa study | $54 USD | 42 EUR |
| Visa issuance | $177 USD | 101 EUR |
| Cedula de Extranjería | $246.000 COP | $246.000 COP |

## Application process

This process [is common to any type of visa application](https://www.notion.so/General-visa-application-rules-1dc2c565143e4adb95086f993f184e36?pvs=21), and includes the steps of application form submission, study fee payment, requirements response, and visa approval and registration, as described here:

### 1. **Submit the application**

The application process is made online from [this link](https://tramitesmre.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites/enlinea/solicitarVisa.xhtml).

You can find a walkthrough guide (in spanish) in [this link](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/visa-linea).

They will ask you about your personal info (academic training, current job, address, etc), family info, migration history in Colombia, and whether you have applied before, if you\`ve had a Colombian visa before or if you have been subject to sanctions (in case you overstayed). Be transparent and don't make typing mistakes!

In the last section of the form, you will find a table where you will have to upload your documents. Keep in mind: All the documents cannot be more than 5mb in total, so compress them accordingly. You can't submit more than 35 pages in total. Check if any of your PDFs is secured with encryption and remove such protection.

### 2. **Make the first payment**

Once submitted your application, you will receive an email with an **unique identification number (save this number, you will need it to track the visa status and to modify your application, if needed)** of your process. In the same email you will get the instructions to pay for the study of the Visa which is $54.92USD or $42.25EUR if you are applying from Europe or Cuba.

You must pay within ten (10) days once you have applied. **If you don’t pay in this period, your visa application will be not admitted, meaning that you will have to reapply.**

### 3.  **Respond to “Requerimientos” (requests), if asked.**

The authorities may ask you for additional information about your visa application. Such as the name of your employer, your address in Colombia, to clarify your relevant data or whatever they think necessary to “protect national security”.

It is important that these requirements are responded to as soon as possible, and that any additional required documents are attached. That is why it is important that at the time of submitting the application, you have all the required documents mentioned above, with the legal formalities when needed (notarization, apostille, translation...). This is because the authorities may give a short deadline to provide missing documents, and it may not be possible to obtain all the documentation within such short notice.

If you do not respond to the requirements, your visa may be denied or deemed inadmissible, although typically it is only deemed inadmissible. Notice that if your visa is denied, you will have to wait for 6 months to apply again for any kind of Colombian visa, and if is unadmitted, you can reapply right away, but you will have to pay again the $54.92USD.

To respond to the authority's request, you will need to enter into the same form of your initial application and re-enter your passport data and fill the field of "Application registry number" with the Unique Identification Number you got in your first submission. Then you forward until the upload documents section and attach the required info.

### 4. Visa approval and registration

According to the law ([Resolución 5477 de 2022, art, 13](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5477_2022.htm#13)), the authorities will take up to 30 days to approve, reject as inadmissible or deny your request. If your visa has been deemed inadmissible, you can re-apply right away, if your visa is denied or "Negada", you will have to leave the country in 30 days and wait 6 months to reapply.

You will get an email. If it is approved, it will have a payment link. You must pay the issuance fees **($232 USD) within 10 days, otherwise the request will be archived and the visa denied.**

After that payment, you will shortly get another email with your beautiful visa in pdf format. Print it and save it in a good place.

After you get your visa, it is [mandatory](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5477_2022.htm#118) to get registered at Migración Colombia as a foreigner and get a foreign ID card (cédula de extranjería), it will also be needed in order to open a bank account or hire local services (TV, internet, and so on). We will write another Pdf in the future about how to get a cédula de extranjería, migratory movements certificate, “salvoconductos” and other procedures.

# **FAQ**

### **When should I apply?**

The moment to apply depends on each individual’s travel plans. But keep in mind that this process can take up to 30 - 40 days, in which you must maintain your legal migratory status. If you are applying from Colombia, you will have to check that your entrance permit (tourism stamp) remains valid throughout the whole process.

**If your 180 days are about to end**, you will need to go to an office of Migración Colombia 5 business days before your entrance stamp expires to obtain a "salvoconducto." This is a temporary authorization to stay in the country during the time of your visa process. However, some offices, like the one in Medellín, do not issue Salvoconductos for people under a current Tourism Permit.

**If your 180 days have already expired and you are in the country irregularly**, you should be aware that your chances of obtaining a visa will be low because you already have a record of staying beyond the permitted time without authorization, and this may raise suspicion with the officer reviewing your visa application. However, you can approach Migración Colombia to carry out an administrative process, in which you will have to pay a fine for staying beyond the permitted time. After an officer from Migración Colombia issues a resolution deciding the fine, you must pay it and then request the “salvoconducto” to apply for the visa.

### **What is an apostille?**

It is [a certificate that authenticates the origin of a document](https://www.notion.so/What-is-an-apostille-418eff889cee4a2abc6408a7b3b1ec09?pvs=21), making it valid for use in other countries. It can be obtained by contacting the competent authority in the country where the document was issued and following their specific requirements. In the United States, for example, the document is submitted to the Secretary of State's office in the state where the document was issued and they will make the apostille. This is not done in Colombia nor can be done in Colombia.

### **Do I need to pay taxes in Colombia?**

Getting a visa does not automatically make you a tax resident.

You become a tax resident when you spend more than 183 days (continous or mixed) within a 365 days period.

Once you are a tax resident you are obliged to file your income tax declaration to the authorities the next immediate year after you get your tax residency. Nobody will send you a reminder, you need to keep track of this yourself.

Colombia has signed several different international treaties to avoid double taxation on income tax (with UK, France, Japan, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, among others). You can find the list [here](https://www.dian.gov.co/normatividad/convenios/Paginas/ConveniosTributariosInternacionales.aspx).

Tax obligations are different for every case and must be analyzed within a tax planning strategy, you should ask your reliable local accountant for more info.

### **Which authority is in charge of this, where I can direct further questions?**

The competent authority is the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Cancillería](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/visa). Migración Colombia is another entity which is responsible for foreign registry, border control, issuance of foreign ID cards among other things but does not make the decision on visas.

### **Does the Digital Nomad Visa count towards residency by accumulated time?**

It doesn’t. It being a Visitor type of visa doesn't count towards residency, you want an M visa type visa for that purpose.

### **Is it possible to apply for the Digital Nomad Visa while in Colombia as a tourist?**

Yes, you can apply for the visa while being in Colombia, when you are filling the form, select the Bogotá Office and attach your passport entry stamp.

### **Is there a restriction on how many times this visa can be used?**

There is no restriction on how many times you can enter and exit the country during the vigency of the visa.`,n={title:"V - Digital Nomad",type:"Visitor",beneficiaries:["yes"],workPermit:["no"],sponsored:["no"],countries:["Exempted"]},i={type:"content",filePath:"/Users/danielluque/Projects/capitalm-website/src/content/visas/en/v-digital-nomad.mdx",rawData:void 0};export{i as _internal,a as body,t as collection,n as data,e as id,o as slug};

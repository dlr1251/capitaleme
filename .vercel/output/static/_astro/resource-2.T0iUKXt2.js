Date of the trip
I/E - Referring to whether it is an immigration (I) or entry into the country, or an emigration (E), or exit from the country.
Destination or origin - City to which you are traveling or from where you are coming.
Type of travel document - It is the type of document with which you were identified at the time of going through the migration control process. It can be a Passport, Citizenship ID, Foreign ID, or identity document.
Travel condition: In the case of Colombians, this field is not relevant. In the case of foreigners, it refers to the type of permit or visa through which entry into the country was authorized. Here we will see if the foreigner entered with a tourism permit (PT), other activities (POA), integration and development (PID), Visitor (V), Migrant (M), or Resident (R) visa.
PCM: Refers to the Migration Control Post through which they entered or left the country.
Ordinarily, this certificate reflects the entries and exits from the country for the last 5 years. If records from earlier are required, it is possible, but the procedure must be carried out in person at one of the Service Facilitation Centers - Colombia Migration Offices - in the country.`}),`

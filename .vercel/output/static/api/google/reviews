He gave me a checklist, they reviewed my materials before I submitted, and when anything confusing came up he was always available. There were some extra steps for someone who is self-employed that I hadn't anticipated - I really appreciate his promptness in responding, and his communication by email and WhatsApp so I can refer back to materials as I need to. He even scheduled my immigration appointment to get my ID card when new appointments were finally added after the new year (and going like hotcakes!). I highly recommend Daniel if you need someone to help you with your visa process.","time":1707145469,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Leaf LeFraug","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015326328068102923/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUahNS-GLKBzWHQDPZntZtZVtdheM-BJWC9D9mB2N5iQw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"Highly recommend Daniel! He helped our family with a digital nomad visa which had a few complications due to being self employed and a few other things. He was with us through the process and helped us obtain our visas. Since we are still learning Spanish he would let us call him when needed and would translate if we were at the immigration office or notary. He later helped us with the purchase of a property which had a challenging seller but he really helped with them and even while he was out of town since he knew the deal was time sensitive! He speaks great English and is very reasonably priced. Weâ€™ll definitely use Daniel when we re-apply for our visas or for anything else.","time":1698070644,"translated":false},{"author_name":"Myah Pacheco","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102908266167335572115/reviews","language":"en","original_language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUgnPqWgDK_9h04wiUlSt2oSvW04KAc-DXXtWxX5xNp5xA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I was so impressed by the services of Daniel and Capital M.

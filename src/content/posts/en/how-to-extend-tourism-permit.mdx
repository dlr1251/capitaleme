## ***How to extend your current Tourism Permit.***

This extension is requested online through the Unique Migration Procedures Form of Migration Colombia ([Formulario Unico de Trámites](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf)). In said form, select the required procedure, which will be the Extension of Stay, and the office of the Facilitator Center for Migration Services where you want to submit the request. It is recommended to use a less congested office than Medellin for this procedure as it is 100% online. It is not recommended for other types of procedures such as the Foreigner ID or the Salvoconducto or Migration Movements since, in these cases, you must go to the office in person.

The extension must be requested at least 5 business days before the 90 days or the days obtained in the current stamp expire. It is recommended to request the extension about 10 or 15 business days before the expiration of the first permit. You cannot request it too far in advance because this is a common cause of rejection.

In that online form, you must attach your passport, the last entrance stamp and the ticket for your departure from the country.

As of 2023, it costs $125,000 COP. For citizens of the Schengen area, the value is $0.

Between February and May 2023, there has been a significant delay in the issuance of stay extensions in the Medellin office. Several delay situations have been reported in the issuance of extensions, causing great congestion and chaos. We have spoken with Migration officials from the Medellin office, and they have told us that they have a problem with the platform that they are trying to resolve.

If you wish, you can hire Capital M to carry out this procedure for you for a value of $270,000 COP.

Once you submit the form and make the payment, you will receive an email with a pdf attachment, where you will find your Temporary Stay Permit - Extension of Stay (Permiso Temportal de Permanencia - Prórroga de Permanencia).

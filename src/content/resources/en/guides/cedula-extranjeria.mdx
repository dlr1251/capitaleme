The Cédula de Extranjería (Foreign ID Card) is an identification document given to foreigners who have a visa valid for more than 3 months, either as the main holder or as a beneficiary.

You can only access the foreigner ID card if you have been issued a visa by the Ministry of Foreign Relations of Colombia.

The foreigner ID card will be your official identification in Colombia to acquire services and enter into contracts like any other Colombian national.

Once your visa has been approved, you will have 15 days to process your foreigner ID card, otherwise you may be subject to fines.

The foreigner ID card is obtained at the Colombia Immigration office and the process involves both a digital and in-person component.

## How to get it?

Once you have obtained your visa, you should follow these steps:

1. **Fill out the single procedures form (FUT) [here](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf;jsessionid=3C1428707C7A74945E91CD0A37AC4A69)**. 
2. Within the form, you should attach the Visa and Passport in a single PDF document.
3. **Save the FUT number.** Once you have completed the FUT form, the website will provide you with a FUT number. This number should be saved.

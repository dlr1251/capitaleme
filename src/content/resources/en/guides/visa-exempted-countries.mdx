Colombia, like any other sovereign country, has diplomatic relations with other states. 

According to international policies between nations, certain restrictions and migratory benefits have been defined for specific nationalities.

[Resolution 5488 of 2022](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5488_2022.htm), issued by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, determined which countries are exempt from a short-stay visa to enter Colombia and which ones are not. 

Most countries that have had any type of “close” relationship with Colombia (USA, Canadá, Latin America, Europe, Australia, Japan, NATO countries, among others) are short-term visa excempted countries. 

Those exempt from the short-stay visa can obtain a tourist permit or "tourist stamp" from Migration Colombia, valid for 90 days initially, extendable for another 90 days. 

Those who are not exempt from the short-stay visa require a visa issued by the Ministry of Foreign Relations to enter the country and this visa must be requested from abroad.

In the list, you will find which countries are currently excepmted for short- term visas and which are not. You can confirm this information in the official website of the [Ministry of Foreign Relations of Colombia](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/visa/lista-a-b-c).

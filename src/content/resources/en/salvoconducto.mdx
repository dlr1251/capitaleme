## What is a Salvoconducto?

A Salvoconducto is an exceptional, temporary permit issued by Migraci√≥n Colombia that allows its holder to stay legally in Colombia for an extra 30 days, that can be extended for 30 days more.

The ‚Äúsalvoconducto‚Äù is issued under two modalities, to *stay in the country* or *to leave the country*. The salvoconducto can be issued under the following circumstances:

1. **To leave the country**
- In case your visa application has been **denied**
- When a foreigner is born in Colombia but is not eligible for Colombian nationality.
- When a foreigner stays in the country irregularly, after paying any applicable fines, they may be issued a Safe-conduct permi

2. **To stay in the country**
- Para Solicitar Visa o Cambiar Visa. Documentos que permitan inferir a la Autoridad Migratoria que el extranjero cumple con los requisitos para solicitar un visado.
- In case you have overstayed and paid the fine in the country.

üí° The salvoconducto is exceptionally issued and it does not accrue time towards residency.

> üí° **Important note:** Not everyone meets the requirements to obtain a "salvoconducto"; this will depend on each specific case and also on the immigration officer who reviews your case. People who have a visa that will soon expire may obtain one. People who have a tourism permit can apply if they have a visa in process, depending on which immigration office the process is carried out. For people who are in the country irregularly, it is most likely that they must first pay a fine and undergo an administrative process to be able to obtain a "salvoconducto" afterwards. It is important to consult with a lawyer to know if this procedure is really the one that applies to your case or if perhaps it is better to extend your stay or carry out an administrative process and pay a fine first before obtaining the "salvoconducto".

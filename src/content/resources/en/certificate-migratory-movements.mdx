## What is it?
The Certificate of Migratory Movements (*Certificado de Movimientos Migratorios*) is an official document that certifies the entries and exits from the Colombian territory of a Colombian national or a foreigner.

This document consists of a table of records with several columns, each entry will contain:

1. Name and surname of the traveler
2. Date of the trip
3. I/E - Referring to whether it is an entry (I - Inmigraci√≥n) into the country, or an exit (E - Emigraci√≥n) from the country.
4. Destination or origin - City to which you are traveling or from where you are coming.
5. Type of travel document - It is the type of document with which you were identified at the time of going through the migration control process. It can be a Passport, Citizenship ID, Foreign ID, or identity document.
6. Travel condition: (only for foreigners). In the case of foreigners, it refers to the type of permit or visa through which the entrance into the country was authorized. Here we will see if the foreigner entered with a tourism permit (PT), other activities (POA), integration and development (PID), Visitor (V), Migrant (M), or Resident (R) visa.
7. PCM: Refers to the Migration Control Point through which they entered or left the country.

Ordinarily, this certificate reflects the entries and exits from the country for the last 5 years. If records from earlier are required, it is possible, but the procedure must be carried out in person at one of the Migraci√≥n Colombia Offices.

Here is an example of this document:

This document is a necessary requirement to apply for certain visa categories, for example, the [Marriage visa](/visas/m-marriage), [Civil Union](/visas/m-civil-union), [Parent of a Colombian National](/visas/m-parent-national), the [Resident visa for Accumulated Time](/visas/r-accrued-time) and for the Visa Transfer (Traspaso).

## What is it?
The Certificate of Migratory Movements (*Certificado de Movimientos Migratorios*) is an official document that certifies the entries and exits from Colombian territory of a Colombian national or a foreigner.

This document consists of a table of records with several columns, each entry will contain:

1. Name and surname of the traveler
2. Date of the trip
3. I/E - Referring to whether it is an immigration (I) or entry into the country, or an emigration (E), or exit from the country.
4. Destination or origin - City to which you are traveling or from where you are coming.
5. Type of travel document - It is the type of document with which you were identified at the time of going through the migration control process. It can be a Passport, Citizenship ID, Foreign ID, or identity document.
6. Travel condition: In the case of Colombians, this field is not relevant. In the case of foreigners, it refers to the type of permit or visa through which entry into the country was authorized. Here we will see if the foreigner entered with a tourism permit (PT), other activities (POA), integration and development (PID), Visitor (V), Migrant (M), or Resident (R) visa.
7. PCM: Refers to the Migration Control Point through which they entered or left the country.

Ordinarily, this certificate reflects the entries and exits from the country for the last 5 years. If records from earlier are required, it is possible, but the procedure must be carried out in person at one of the Migraci√≥n Colombia Offices in the country.

Here is an example of this document:

This document is a necessary requirement to apply for certain visa categories, among others, the [Marriage visa](/visas/m-marriage), [Civil Union](/visas/m-civil-union), [Parent of a Colombian National](/visas/m-parent-national), and the [Resident visa for Accumulated Time](/visas/r-accrued-time).

The procedure to obtain the Migration Movements Certificate consists of filling out the Single Procedure Form of Migraci√≥n Colombia (Formulario Unico de Tramites), paying the fees, and once the document is ready, you will receive an email stating that the document is ready to be picked up, after this you must book an appointment to go in person to the Migraci√≥n Colombia office where the procedure was filed.

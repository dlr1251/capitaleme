## Foreword

If you have an ongoing civil union with a Colombian national, you are eligible to apply for the Colombian civil union visa.

In Colombia, a civil union (Unión marital de hecho) refers to a legally recognized partnership between two individuals who are in a committed, cohabitating relationship akin to marriage. It is a legal framework that grants certain rights and responsibilities to unmarried couples, regardless of their gender.

To establish a civil union in Colombia, the couple must meet specific criteria, including mutual consent, a stable and continuous relationship, and cohabitation for two years. Once registered, the civil union provides legal protection and benefits similar to those enjoyed by married couples, such as inheritance rights, healthcare coverage, social security benefits, and property rights.

It's important to note that civil unions in Colombia are distinct from marriage. While marriage is a formal union recognized by law, civil unions are an alternative legal recognition for couples who choose not to marry or are unable to do so.

The M - Civil Union visa is an M-type (Migrante) visa. This means that it allows you to accrue time towards residency and that you can loose your visa if you stay out of the country for 6 continous months.

This visa category, although easy to get, comes with some rules you need to know about losing this visa. Specifically, your spouse will be entitled to cancel your visa if you get separated.

## Specific requirements

### 1. Civil union certificate

Authenticated copy of the public deed, judicial ruling, or conciliation agreement; or a certificate of validity when applicable, issued no more than three (3) months prior, declaring the existence of the civil union. The date of formalization of the document supporting the civil union must be more than one (1) year prior to the visa application.
When applying for a visa as a permanent partner of a Colombian national at a Consular Office of the Republic, a valid document proving the civil union will be accepted in accordance with the laws of the place where its existence was declared, with compliance with the formalities prescribed for foreign documents, that is, the apostille and a certified translation to Spanish.

### 2. Motivation letter signed by your Colombian partner

You must attach a visa request letter signed and notarized by your Colombian partner, through which he/she will state your current effective cohabitation. 

The letter must state that you maintain a unique, constant, persevering, and stable cohabitation, and committing to inform the Visa and Immigration Authority of any changes in the circumstances of the cohabitation. The letter must include a simple photocopy of the Colombian citizenship card and provide the contact address, email, and phone number of the Colombian partner.

On this letter, it is recommended to include a detailed narrative that comprehensively describes your relationship,  including the following details: the date and location (city and country) of when and where you first met, the circumstances of how you met, the commencement of your romantic relationship, the decision to live together, your current place of residence, the dynamics of your relationship with each other's families, any previous marriages (including the name and nationality of the spouse), and information about any children (please attach birth certificates for children born before or after the union).

### 3. Special power of representation

Special power of attorney, duly recognized and signed before a notary or Colombian consul, granting the foreign partner the authority to apply for this type of visa.

This is a special power that the Colombian spouse grants to his/her foreign partner to apply for this visa.

### 4. Certificate of migratory movements

You will need to present the certificate of migratory movements of both you and your spouse. These are called “Certificado de Movimientos Migratorios”

### 5. A valid **health insurance (optional)**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme)

1. Has 2 years validity by default. 
2. Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month.

5. They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in english, german, italian…) 
6. Has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

### 6. Personal **bank statements (optional)**

Demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to live in the country and cover all your expenses. You will need to provide your bank statements from the three months prior to the visa application. For example, if you are applying for the visa in January, you will need to provide your bank statements for December, November, and October. They can be in english, no need to translate them, but if they are in other language, you must translate them.

Those statements must show that you earn at least three Colombian minimum wages. As of 2023, the Colombian minimum wage is $1,160,000 COP or $722.31 USD (as for - feb. 27 - 2023 exchange rate. Beware of peso volatility!). You don’t need the full transactions list, if you can get a summary or balance from each month, that would be enough.

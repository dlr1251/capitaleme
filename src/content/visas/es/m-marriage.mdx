## Who can apply for this type of visa?

This visa category is suited “*For foreigners who have a marital bond with a Colombian citizen and aspire to effectively live with their Colombian spouse in the country*”.

Any foreigner over 18 with a currently recognized marriage in Colombia is eligible for this visa category.

If you are married with a Colombian national, you are eligible to apply for the Colombian marriage visa.

The M - Marriage visa is an M-type (Migrante) visa. This means that it allows you to accrue time towards residency and that you can lose your visa if you stay out of the country for 6 continuos months.

This visa category, although easy to get, comes with some rules you need to know about losing this visa. Specifically, your spouse will be entitled to cancel your visa if you get divorced or even if you are separated, without formalizing the divorce.

If you currently have a *real* marriage with a Colombian national, this is one of the best visa options to apply for.

Some people may think that getting married solely for the visa purposes can be a good idea. However, this may not be the case in the long run. Specially if you don’t know your spouse quite well.

## Specific requirements

### 1. Colombian marriage certificate

You will need an *authentic copy* of your Colombian marriage certificate. The Colombian marriage certificate, is normally found at the *Registraduría del Estado Civil* where your marriage was registered.

If you are getting married in Colombia, remember that the foreign spouse must bring an apostilled, oficially translated birth certificate from his country of origin and a certificate of single marital status. The Colombian spouse will be able to get married with his/her ***Registro civil de nacimiento*** and his/her Colombian cédula de ciudadanía.

If you got married in Colombia, you will be able to get this certificate at the Notary where your marriage was issued. Remember that the Colombian marriage certificate (Registro civil de matrimonio) is different than the public deed (escritura pública) of the marriage.

If you got married abroad, consider that you will need to protocolize your foreign marriage before the Registraduría del Estado Civil. In order to do so, you must bring your apostilled, oficially translated marriage certificate from abroad, and if you have signed pre-nuptial agreements abroad, you must bring them aswell, with the aforementioned formalities.

This authentic copy of your marriage certificate can’t be more than 3 months old at the time of the visa application.

### 2. Motivation letter signed by your spouse

You must attach a visa request letter signed and notarized by your Colombian spouse, through which he/she will state your current effective cohabitation. 

On this letter, you must include a detailed narrative that comprehensively describes your relationship,  including the following details: the date and location (city and country) of when and where you first met, the circumstances of how you met, the commencement of your romantic relationship, the decision to live together, your current place of residence, the dynamics of your relationship with each other's families, any previous marriages (including the name and nationality of the spouse), and information about any children (please attach birth certificates for children born before or after the union).

Additionally, you can be requested to provide supporting documentation such as flight tickets, hotel reservations, joint purchase invoices, and digital photos from social media. The photos should be arranged in chronological order, starting from the beginning of your relationship up until the present date. Remember to ensure that the dates on the photos are digitally identified (not transcribed) and are not transcribed. The maximum limit of travel and family photos is seven.

Furthermore, you may be requested to include any relevant documents such as a lease agreement or property ownership records of where you live together, as well as any other supporting documents that you consider pertinent to your case.

### 3. Special power of representation

Special power of attorney, duly recognized and signed before a notary or Colombian consul, granting the foreign partner the authority to apply for this type of visa.

This is a special power that the Colombian spouse grants to his/her foreign spouse to apply for this visa.

### 4. Certificate of migratory movements

You will need to present the certificate of migratory movements of both you and your spouse. These are called “Certificado de Movimientos Migratorios”

### 5. A valid **health insurance (optional)**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme)

Genki has the required coverage plus: 

1. Has 2 years validity by default. 
2. Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month. 
3. Can be cancelled anytime 
4. The purchase is quick and online (one business day at the most) 
5. They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in english, german, italian) 
6. Has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

### 6. Personal **bank statements (optional)**

Demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to live in the country and cover all your expenses. You will need to provide your bank statements from the three months prior to the visa application. For example, if you are applying for the visa in January, you will need to provide your bank statements for December, November, and October. They can be in english, no need to translate them, but if they are in other language, you must translate them.

Those statements must show that you earn at least three Colombian minimum wages. As of 2023, the Colombian minimum wage is $1,160,000 COP or $722.31 USD (as for - feb. 27 - 2023 exchange rate. Beware of peso volatility!). You don’t need the full transactions list, if you can get a summary or balance from each month, that would be enough.

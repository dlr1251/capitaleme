You will need to provide a signed letter in which you explain the official name of your company, the address, the NIT (Tax Identification Number), the main activity that the company will carry out, and how many jobs the company generates or plans to generate. It is advisable to mention the reasons for investing in Colombia, the expectations with the company, and a portfolio of products or services that the company will introduce to the market.

Provide the documents that support the incorporation of the company or, when you invest in an operating company, the purchase of shares, for a value of at least 100 Colombian minimum wages. 

Currently, in 2025, the minimum wage is **$1,423,500 COP * 100 = $142,350,000 COP**, and provide the company's bank statements.

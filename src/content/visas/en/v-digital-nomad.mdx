## What are its benefits and restrictions?

### **Up to two years validity**

It allows you to live and work remotely from Colombia for up to two (2) years. It also allows you to get a foreign ID card (Cédula de extranjería).

Although some people say is valid only for 6 months, [this is not true. TL;DR.](https://www.capitaleme.com/blog/post-4) It is valid for up to two (2) years, not 180 days as many say*.*

### **No work permit**

Does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since it doesn’t have a work permit.

### **This visa admits beneficiaries**

It allows you to bring your Spouse and children under 25 as beneficiaries once your visa gets approved.

### **No time accrue towards residency**

Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, it won’t allow you to accrue time in order to apply for a residency or (R) visa.

## What do I need to apply?

### 1. Evidence of remote work

This requirement can be met in different manners, depending on wether you are applying as a) an employee; b) an independent contractor (freelancer); c) an entrepreneur – founder / owner of a foreign company; or d) as a digital entrepreneur.

#### **a) Applying as an employee**

If you are applying as an employee, you need to get ****a letter in Spanish or English, signed by your employer (CEO or Legal Representative), indicating your position, your annual or monthly salary and that your job is performed remotely. If you have an offer letter or an employment contract, provide it as well.

#### **b) Applying as an independent contractor or freelance**

You will need a letter from your clients stating the type of work you perform, the salary or fees you receive and that the service is performed remotely. If you have an independent contractor agreement, provide it also. 

#### **c) Applying as a business owner**

**If you own** a company registered abroad, you will need to submit the certificate of incorporation and certificate of good standing from your company, apostilled and officially translated to Spanish. 

#### **d) Applying as a digital entrepreneur**

**If you are applying as a digital entrepreneur**, you will need to provide a motivational letter explaining your project and why will be of interest for Colombia, the financial and human resources you have or intend to have to start the project.

### 2. Health insurance

You must have a health insurance policy that provides coverage in Colombia for risks including: *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death, and repatriation*, with at least one (1) year of validity.

We recommend [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme) to fulfill this requirement, as it offers:

2. Monthly payments starting at 65 EUR
3. The option to cancel at any time

5. Issuance of a health coverage summary in Spanish
6. Successful use by many of our clients in obtaining their visas

### 3. Personal bank statements

Provide your bank statements from the three months prior to the visa application. 

Those statements must show that you earn at least three Colombian minimum wages per month.

As of 2024, the Colombian minimum wage is $1,300,000 COP*3 = $3,900,000 COP.

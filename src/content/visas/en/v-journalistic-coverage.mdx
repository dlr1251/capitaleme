## Who can apply for this type of visa?

Journalists often require a special kind of visa because their work involves reporting on events and gathering information in countries other than their own. These visas, commonly known as journalist visas or press visas, are specifically designed to grant journalists the necessary legal permission to enter a country and perform their professional duties.

They also need to be aware of the country’s media and journalism laws and also the necessary protection to carry out their duties.

The V - Journalistic coverage allows its holder to carry out short-term journalistic coverage in the country.

## What are the benefits and restrictions for this visa?

### **Up to one year validity, but 180 usable days**

The granted stay for short-term journalistic coverage or temporary residence as a foreign press correspondent shall not exceed one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days, whether consecutive or non-consecutive

### **No beneficiaries**

This visa category doesn’t allow for beneficiaries

### Restricted **work permit**

This visitor visa allows to perform exclusively the authorized activity, in this case, the journalistic coverage.

Any passport holder of one of the short-stay visa exempted countries (like US, Canada, Australia, European Union, Israel, Argentina and many others) don’t need to apply for this visa, as long as they don’t stay more than 180 calendar days and **don’t receive salary from a Colombian company or public entity.**

### **No time accrue towards residency**

Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, this won’t allow you to add time in order to apply for a residency or (R) visa.

## Specific Requirements

In order to apply for this visa, you will need to show evidence of your investment in a Colombian Property, a health insurance and financial solvency, which we will explain further below.

### 1. Certificate of ownership  (‚ÄùCertificado de libertad y tradici√≥n‚Äù)

This is an official document issued by the Public Registry of Property. It provides detailed information about the legal status, ownership history, and any encumbrances or liens on a specific property.

The important thing, is that this certificate has in the last page your name and the amount you have paid for that property. 

This certificate should not be older than 90 days old at the time of your visa application.

You can get this certificate on this link https://certificados.supernotariado.gov.co/certificado by typing the ‚Äúmatr√≠cula inmobiliaria‚Äù of your property. It costs $19.200 cop.

This is an example of the ‚Äúcertificado de libertad y tradici√≥n‚Äù:

![This is just an example. But this is the kind of certificate you will need to apply for this visa.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5ba766a1-ea5e-4bc0-88f5-29aa4760f982/36b25ddf-65b9-4749-81ec-db4eb17eb30c/Untitled.webp)

This is just an example. But this is the kind of certificate you will need to apply for this visa.

<aside>
üí° This certificate will need to show that you have purchased the company for a price of at least 350 Colombian minimum wages. At 2024, the minimum wage in Colombia is $1.300.000 COP. *350 = **$455.000.000 COP.**

</aside>

<aside>
üí° Be aware that the price of the property needs to keep being 350 minimum wages for second and third applications on this visa category. **In Colombia, the minimum wage increases a certain amount every year on January 1st.**

### 2. Certificate of Direct Foreign Investment issued by the Central Bank

This is an official document issued by the Colombian Central Bank (Banco de la Rep√∫blica) to certify foreign capital inflows into the country. It serves as proof of investment made by foreign individuals or entities in Colombia.

The Certificate of Foreign Investment is obtained by submitting relevant information and documentation to the Central Bank, which includes details about the investor, the nature of the investment, and the amount of capital being brought into the country. The certificate is typically requested by the investor to demonstrate compliance with foreign exchange regulations and to access certain benefits and protections provided by the Colombian government.

If you have done the payment of your property with a brokerage agency, they will fill the necessary information before the Central Bank by filling the Form no. 4, and what you will need to submit for your visa application its just the ‚Äúinvestment extract‚Äù which you can get in the official website of the Central Bank:

<aside>
üí° We will also need to show in this certificate that you have brought at least $406.000.000 (In 2023).

</aside>

### 3. Personal **bank statements**

Demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to live in the country and cover all your expenses. You will need to provide your bank statements from the three months prior to the visa application. 

For example, if you are applying for the visa in January, you will need to provide your bank statements for December, November, and October. They can be in english, no need to translate them, but if they are in other language, you must translate them.

### **4. Health insurance policy**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for at least one year. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

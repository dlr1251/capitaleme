## What do I need to apply?

### 1. Certificate of ownership  (‚ÄùCertificado de libertad y tradici√≥n‚Äù)

This is an official document issued by the Public Registry of Property (Registro de Instrumentos P√∫blicos). It provides detailed information about the legal status, ownership history, and any encumbrances or liens on a specific property.

You can get this certificate on this link https://certificados.supernotariado.gov.co/certificado by typing the property registration number (‚Äúmatr√≠cula inmobiliaria‚Äù) of the property. It costs $20.900 COP (as of 2024).

This certificate should not be older than 90 days old at the time of your visa application.

This is just an example. But this is the kind of certificate you will need to apply for this visa.


> üí° This certificate needs to show that you have purchased the property for a price of at least 350 Colombian minimum wages. At 2024, the minimum wage in Colombia is $1.300.000 COP. Therefore, the minumum ammount is **$455.000.000 COP for 2024.**
Be aware that the price of the property needs to keep being 350 minimum wages for second and third applications on this visa category. **In Colombia, the minimum wage increases a certain amount every year on January 1st.**

It is also required to demonstrate that you are the exclusive owner of the property. If the property is registered under your name along with another individual's name, your application will be denied.


### **2. Direct Foreign Investment Certificate**

The Certificate of Foreign Investment is acquired by providing the Central Bank some details about the investment.

Should you have transferred your funds for property purchase in Colombia via a brokerage agency (such as Acciones y Valores or Alianza), they will complete the required information on your behalf and you will be able to download the certificate in the Central Bank‚Äôs website.

### 3. Personal **bank statements**

Provide your bank statements from the three months prior to the visa application. Those statements must show that you have financial solvency to cover all your expenses in Colombia.

### **4. Health insurance policy**

You must have a health insurance policy that provides coverage in Colombia for risks including: *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death, and repatriation*, with at least one (1) year of validity.

We recommend [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme) to fulfill this requirement, as it offers:

1. A default validity of 2 years.
2. Monthly payments starting at 65 EUR.
3. The option to cancel at any time.
4. Quick and online purchase process (within one business day).
5. Issuance of a health coverage summary in Spanish.
6. Successful use by many of our clients in obtaining their visas.

>**If you are applying for a second time with this visa, you will need to proof you have held the investment in your property. This is normally achieved by showing payment for the utilities, payment of property taxes, HOA fees payments, among others.

## Who can apply for this type of visa?

<aside>
üí° In Colombia, there are different hiring modalities, among them, a labor contract (contrato laboral) or a services agreement (prestaci√≥n de servicios). These contracts have different regulations: Service agreements are ruled by the commerce Law and labor agreements by the labor Law. Under the labor contract, there is a specific modality called ‚Äúobra o labor‚Äù, which can be roughly translated as ‚Äú***specific project***‚Äù. This modality refers to a labor contract that doesn‚Äôt have a specific time of termination, and is valid until the project for which the worker was hired for is finished.

## Who can apply for this visa?

In some events, a foreigner might have to come to Colombia to work under a per project contract for a company, government agency or legal entity.

> üí° In Colombia, there are different hiring modalities, among them, a labor contract (contrato laboral) or a services agreement (prestaci√≥n de servicios). These contracts have different regulations: Service agreements are ruled by the commerce Law and labor agreements by the labor Law. Under the labor contract, there is a specific modality called ‚Äúobra o labor‚Äù, which can be roughly translated as ‚Äú***specific project***‚Äù. This modality refers to a labor contract that doesn‚Äôt have a specific time of termination, and is valid until the project for which the worker was hired for is finished.


This visa allows its holder to temporarily carry out tasks in Colombia under a services agreement or specific project contract.

This visa is open to any passport holder.

## Who must apply for this visa?

Nationals from countries that are not exempt from the short-stay visa requirement for Colombia, who wish to visit the country for tourism or cultural purposes.
> üí° Passport holders from any of the short-term visa exempted countries do not need to apply for this visa.


## What are its benefits and restrictions?

### **You can visit the country for up to 90 days**

This visa can be valid for up to one (1) year. However, the authorized stay in Colombia will be 90 days (continous or discontinous). Those 90 days may be extended for 90 more. In any case, after staying in Colombia for more than 180 days in a 365 days period (starting from the date the visa was approved), you won‚Äôt be able to use this visa anymore and you will most likely have to either wait for the next year or to apply for a different visa category.

### **No beneficiaries**

It does not allow you to bring your Spouse or your kids with you. Each family member needs to apply for this visa separately.

### **No work permit**

This type of visa does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since it doesn‚Äôt have a work permit.

### **No time accrue towards residency**

Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, it won‚Äôt allow you to add time in order to apply for a resident (R) visa.

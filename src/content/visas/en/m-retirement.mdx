## Who can apply for this type of visa?

The Colombian Retirement Visa is open to any individual who receives a pension from a foreign government.

In recent years, Colombia has emerged as a highly sought-after destination for individuals seeking an enchanting place to retire. Nestled in the heart of South America, this vibrant country offers a unique blend of natural beauty, rich culture, and warm hospitality, making it an irresistible choice for retirees looking for a new chapter in their lives.

For successfully retiring in Colombia, and making it your second home, you will need a visa to stay and live in the country, as well as to get a Foreign ID Card (C√©dula de extranjer√≠a). 

## What are the benefits and restrictions for this visa?

### **Up to three years validity**

The Colombian Retirement Visa allows you to live for up to three (3) years. It also allows you to get a foreign ID card (C√©dula de extranjer√≠a).

### **This visa admits beneficiaries**

With this visa you will be able to bring your family with you as beneficiaries. That is, you can bring your spouse and/or children to live with you, once the main visa is approved.

### **No work permit**

Please notice that this type of visa does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since you are supposed to be retired already.

### **Accumulates time towards residency**

This visa allows you to accrue time towards residency. After having had this visa for five (5) continous years, you will be eligible to apply for a Resident type visa.

## Specific Requirements

In order to apply for this visa, [besides the general requirements](https://www.notion.so/General-visa-application-rules-1dc2c565143e4adb95086f993f184e36?pvs=21) for any visa application, you will need to show evidence of your pension, a health insurance and financial solvency, which we will explain further below.

### 1. Pension certificate

You will need a certificate, document or letter from the government entity that handles pension manner stating the fixed amount they pay you monthly as a pension. **This amount must be three times the Colombia minimum wage.**

In 2023, the minimum wage in Colombia is $1.160.000 cop x 3 = $3.480.000 cop or around $900 usd.

If you are a retired from the United States, what you will need is the social benefit verification letter:

*Example*:

You can see how to download this letter in this [link](https://www.ssa.gov/manage-benefits/get-benefit-letter).

After you have this letter issued recently, you will need to make an apostille from the country of origin of the document to Colombia.

### 2. Medical certificate

You will need to get a medical certificate stating that you don't suffer any illness and you can live well in society. This needs to be signed by a Colombian certified doctor. We recommend you do this with your EPS if you have one. If you don‚Äôt have an eps yet, you can check this provider: https://mediqugroup.com/tp_mediqu_group/

### 3. Criminal background check

You will also be required to present your criminal background check issued by the country you have lived the last three years prior to the visa application. This document needs to be apostilled to Colombia and officially translated to Spanish.

If you are from United States, you will need either a State level background check or a FBI background check.

If you choose the FBI, you can mail your fingerprints there and receive your results online. If you choose state level, you will need to check the requirements for each state to issue this background check.

**What happens if I have criminal history?** If you have criminal charges, your chances to get this visa will be lower than if you didn‚Äôt have it. Still you can try by drafting a letter explaining them what happened in each charge and that you are committed to respect the Colombian rules.

### 4. Health coverage

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme)

Genki has the required coverage plus: 

1. Has 2 years validity by default. 
2. Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month. 
3. Can be cancelled anytime 
4. The purchase is quick and online (one business day at the most) 
5. They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in english, german, italian‚Ä¶) 
6. Has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

**What happens if I already have my Colombian EPS?**

You will need to download the certificate of your affiliation issued recently by the EPS. If you have Sura, we highly recommend you to get a ‚Äúcomplementario‚Äù plan to enhance your possibilities to get your visa. But also, take in count that Sura only issues insurances policies for one year and probably they will get you a 1 year pension visa for this.

**I**t is recommended to obtain your health insurance with coverage for at least one year. According to our experience, the visa authorities are setting the validity of the visas based on the coverage period of the health insurance policy.

<aside>
üí° **Consider that, according to the current visa Law, all documents produced abroad must be duly apostilled and officially translated by a certified Colombian translator. These documents can‚Äôt be more than 90 days old at the time of the visa application.**

## Am I eligible for this visa?

You are eligible for this visa if you receive a monthly pension from your home country's government amounting to at least $3,900,000 Colombian Pesos (COP) per month (2024). 

## What are its benefits and restrictions?

### **Up to three years validity**

This visa allows you to stay and live for up to three (3) years in Colombia. It also allows you to get a foreign ID card (Cédula de extranjería). The final time granted on a visa is completely up to the government authorities.

### **This visa admits beneficiaries**

With this visa you will be able to bring your Spouse and children under 25 as beneficiaries once your visa gets approved.

### **No work permit**

This visa does not allow you to work in Colombia, since you are supposed to be retired already.

### **Accrue time towards residency**

This visa allows you to accrue time towards residency. After holding this visa for five (5) continous years, you will be eligible to apply for a Resident type visa.

#### You will get your visa cancelled if you stay out of the country for 6 <u>_continous_</u> months.

## What do I need to apply?

### 1. Pension certificate

You will need a certificate or letter from the government entity that handles pension matters in your country. The certificate must state the fixed amount you receive monthly, which **must be at least three times the Colombian minimum wage.**

In 2024, the minimum wage in Colombia is $1,300,000 COP * 3 = $3,900,000 COP.

If you are retired from the United States of America, the document needed to meet this requirement is the *benefit verification letter* issued by the Social Security Administration

*Example*:
<div class="flex items-center justify-center">
<Image inferSize={true} src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jk_y-HQlvIo3XOEkAjeiXn3EZgtw6T3SXm92Km97lIHFSqp82kHV-s7EkIY5sY7iN7aFCdF9B5yOlfn41ZUmfRQRzQoAUEiEsB28T-tt2GLcQffRig_DFxAaEs8UrPJFHTdmra5V23Ups19Ikcba" alt="Example Social Benefits Letter" />
</div>

You can see how to download this letter through this [website](https://www.ssa.gov/manage-benefits/get-benefit-letter).

This document can’t be more than 90 days old at the time of the visa application submission. It also must get apostilled to Colombia and offically translated to Spanish.

### 2. Psychophysical fitness certificate

You will need to obtain a medical certificate confirming that you are fit to live in society. This certificate must be signed by a doctor certified in Colombia.

We recommend obtaining this certificate through your regular doctor at the EPS (Colombian Healthcare Providers). If you are not yet registered with an EPS, you may consider another provider.

### 3. Criminal background check

You will also be required to present your criminal background check issued by the country in which you have lived for the past three years. This document must be apostilled for Colombia and officially translated into Spanish.

If you are from the United States, you may use either a State-level background check or an FBI background check.

### 4. Health insurance coverage

You must have a health insurance policy that provides coverage in Colombia for risks including: *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death, and repatriation*, with at least one (1) year of validity.

We recommend [Genki](https://genki.world/?with=capitaleme) to fulfill this requirement, as it offers:

1. A default validity of 2 years.
2. Monthly payments starting at 65 EUR.
3. The option to cancel at any time.
4. Quick and online purchase process (within one business day).
5. Issuance of a health coverage summary in Spanish.
6. Successful use by many of our clients in obtaining their visas.

#### What if I already have Colombian EPS coverage?

You should download the certificate of coverage issued by your EPS. For those with Sura coverage, we strongly recommend adding a “complementario” plan to increase your chances of visa approval.

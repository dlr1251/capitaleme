## Who must apply for this type of visa?

An airport transit visa, also known as a transit visa, is a type of visa that allows a traveler to pass through the international transit area of an airport without entering the country to pick another flight. It is typically required when a person needs to change flights in a country but does not intend to enter that country's territory.

The purpose of an airport transit visa is to enable travelers to continue their journey and reach their final destination by connecting flights.

Nationals from any of the countries related on the [Resoluci√≥n 3717 de 2023](https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_3717_2023.htm#INICIO), must apply for this visa.

## What do I need to apply?

### 1. Civil Union certificate

You must present the civil union official certificate. 

Under Colombian Law, to officially recognize a civil union, it must be established by one of three methods: 

- a notarized public deed
- a judgment from court
- a certificate from a recognized Conciliation Center

For this visa category, there’s an additional requirement: the document that verifies the civil union must have been issued **at least one year before** submitting the visa application.

If the civil union with a Colombian citizen was formalized outside of Colombia and you're applying for a visa at a Colombian consulate, you must present the document from the country where the union was declared. This document must be properly apostilled or legalized, ensuring it is valid for use in Colombia and officially translated to Spanish by a Colombian certified translator. 

### 2. Notarized letter from the Colombian partner

You must attach a visa request letter signed and notarized by your Colombian partner, through which he/she will state your current effective cohabitation and supporting your visa request. 

The letter must state that you maintain a unique, constant, persevering, and stable cohabitation, and committing to inform the Visa and Immigration Authority of any changes in the circumstances of the cohabitation. The letter must include a simple copy of the Colombian cédula de ciudadanía and provide the contact address, email, and phone number of the Colombian partner.

### 3. Special power of representation

You must submit a power of attorney signed and notarized by your Colombian partner, granting you the authorization to apply for the visa.

### 4. Certificate of migratory movements

You will need to present the certificate of migratory movements of both you and your spouse. This certificate is issued by Migración Colombia. You can request it by filing this [form](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf) and paying a government fee of $75,000 COP each (2024).

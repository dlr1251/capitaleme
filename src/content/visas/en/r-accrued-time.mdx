If you have held one or more Migrant (M) visas for the legally required duration, you may apply for a Resident visa based on accumulated time.

**How long do I need to accumulate to apply for this visa?**

The amount of time required to be eligible for the Resident visa varies depending on the visa category, see below:

According to to current Visas decree, the previous accumulated visas must have ***continuity of time.***

> **Continuity of time:**  Paragraph 2 of Article 90, Resolution 5477, 2022: â€œFor the purposes of calculating accumulated time, there will be continuity of time **when a visa has been granted before the expiration of the previous visa**. The salvoconducto does not constitute a factor of continuity for the calculation of accumulated time."

## What are its benefits and restrictions?

### Five **years validity - renewable**

It allows you to live and work in Colombia for up to five years. Every five years you will have to do a visa transfer.

### **This visa admits beneficiaries**

It allows you to bring your Spouse and children under 25 as beneficiaries once your visa gets approved.

### Open **work permit**

It allows you to work in Colombia and perform any legal activity.

## What do I need to apply?

### 1. Previous visas

Provide digital copies of all visas you've held while in Colombia, ensuring they were valid throughout their intended periods.

### 2. Certificate of Migratory Movements

You must obtain a certificate from MigraciÃ³n Colombia detailing your immigration movements. You can request it [here](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf).

### 3. Visa Application Letter

In this application letter, you must explain your sources of income, what you do for a living in Colombia, and explain how the circumstances that led to the approval of the previous visas still remain. For example, if you accrued time with a Marriage visa, youâ€™ll need to show that you are still married with a Colombian national.

### 4. Foreign ID card - CÃ©dula de extranjerÃ­a

Submit a copy of your foreign ID card (cÃ©dula de extranjerÃ­a).

> ðŸ’¡ The Visa and Immigration Authority may also check to ensure the applicant is up to date with social security obligations.

## What do I need to apply?

### 1. Colombian birth certificate

When a child is born in Colombia, the hospital or the doctor/nurse who delivers the baby issues a "Live Birth" certificate. The Colombian parent takes this document to a *Registraduría or a Notary,* where they issue a "birth certificate" (Registro Civil de Nacimiento).

For this visa application, you will need to obtain a recent copy of it (no more than 90 days old at the time of the visa application).

### 2. Notarized application letter

You must submit a notarized letter requesting the visa, in which it is declared that you have fulfilled all your obligations as a parent of a Colombian child. This letter will be signed and notarized by the Colombian parent, if applicable.
If both parents are foreigners, they must prepare the letter themselves.
When the Colombian child is of legal age (18 years in Colombia), he or she must sign and notarize the letter requesting the visa for the foreign parents, signing manually and with the fingerprint of their right index finger.

### 3. Valid visa at the time of birth

You must provide the visa you held at the time of your Colombian child's birth.

### 4. Certificate of migratory movements

You will need a certificate of migratory movements for both you and the other parent of the child issued by Migración Colombia. This document can be obtained by filling [this form](https://apps.migracioncolombia.gov.co/registro/public/formularioRegistro.jsf) and paying a fee of $75,000 COP each, when the document is ready you can pick it up at the Migración Office nearest to your address.

### 5. Bank statements

## Who can apply for this type of visa?

This visa category is suited “*For foreigners who have  a Colombian kid*”.

If you are have had a Colombian kid with a Colombian national, in Colombian soil (that’s very Colombian), you are eligible to apply for this visa. 

If both parents are foreigners, the kid can get the Colombian nationality if and only if both parents had an M-type visa at the time of birth.

This visa is an M-type (Migrante) visa. This means that it allows you to accrue time towards residency and that you can loose your visa if you stay out of the country for 6 continous months.

## Requirements

Besides the [general requirements](https://www.notion.so/General-visa-application-rules-1dc2c565143e4adb95086f993f184e36?pvs=21) to apply for any visa, you must attach evidence of the next specific requirements:

### 1. Copy of the Colombian birth certificate of the child

When a child is born in Colombia, the Hospital or the doctor-nurse that delivers the birth issues a certificate of “Live Birth”. The Colombian parent takes this document to a *Registraduría,* where they issue a “certificate of birth” (Registro civil de nacimiento).

For this visa application, you will need to get a recent copy of it (no more than 90 days old at the time of the visa application).

When both parents are foreigners, the Colombian birth certificate of the child born in Colombia should include a note indicating its validity to prove nationality and should be recorded in the database of the Registry Entity. 

Also, when both parents are foreigners, both need to have a current M or R visa at the time of the birth, otherwise the visa application will be rejected.

In the event that the Birth Certificate contains annotations other than those related to nationality, such as a change in serial number, paternal recognition, name change, among others, the respective preceding registration must be provided.

### 2. Letter of visa application

When the Colombian child is under 18 years old, the visa application letter should be signed by the Colombian parent, confirming that the foreign parent is fulfilling their responsibilities towards the child. 

If the Colombian parent's consent is not available, the visa applicant must provide certification from the relevant family authority stating that there are no protective or restorative measures in place and that the foreign parent has been fulfilling their obligations properly. 

If both parents are foreigners, the letter should be signed by both parents. 

If the Colombian child is an adult, they should submit a letter, signed by themselves with their fingerprint, requesting the issuance of a Migrant visa for their foreign parent. This letter should be accompanied by a photocopy of the Colombian citizenship card.

### 3. Valid visa at the time of birth

The foreign father or mother must provide the visa of which they were the holder and that was valid at the time of the child's birth.

### 4. Certificate of migratory movements

Certificate of migration movements of the father and mother of the child issued by the Special Administrative Unit of Migración Colombia.

### 5. Proof of financial solvency and income

Demonstrate financial solvency through average bank statements for the last 6 months and provide proof of income.

### 6. A valid **health insurance (optional)**

It is recommended have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

## Special Requirements

### 1. Motivation Letter

Submit a written communication from the applicant providing their full identification and explaining the activity that the foreigner intends to carry out in the national territory (details, participants, duration, schedule, location, among other aspects).

### 2. Sponsorship or invitation Letter

If the foreigner is invited, they must provide a written request from the Colombian host or a foreign citizen, only if they are the principal holder of a Permanent Resident (R) visa. The request should be handwritten and include the digital fingerprint of the right or left index finger, or right or left thumb, clearly stating their contact phone number, physical address, and email address. The request should also specify the type of relationship or bond with the foreigner and the sponsor's financial responsibility for the expenses related to the foreigner's travel and stay in the national territory. In this request, the sponsor must also register the information of other foreign citizens they have sponsored and commit to ensuring the foreigner's return to their country of origin or to report if the foreigner remains irregular in the national territory.

### 3. Proof of economic solvency of the applicant and/or sponsor

Provide proof of economic solvency of the applicant and/or the individual who extends the invitation through bank statements for the previous six (6) months, demonstrating monthly incomes not less than ten (10) times the current legal monthly minimum wage (SMLMV).

### 4. Evidence of the procedure you are going through

Official document that supports the process you are currently carrying out with the Colombian authority.

### 5. A valid **health insurance**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

There are different options to comply with this requirement. Some of the (cheapests) health insurance providers that have the required coverage include: Genki, Terrawind, Mok, Travel Assist, Qualitas assistance and Travelkit.

Your health insurance should cover you for at least one year. According to our experience, the visa authorities are setting the validity of the digital nomad visa based on the coverage period of the health insurance policy. Therefore, we recommend that you obtain a two-year policy if you want your visa to be valid for two years.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/). Genki has the required coverage plus: 1) has 2 years validity by default. 2) Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month. 3) Can be cancelled anytime 4) The purchase is quick and online (one business day at the most) 5) They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in engligh, german, italian…) 6) has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

## Costs

The total costs vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the applicant. For example, if you have not bought your health insurance and need to buy one for your visa application, that can be costly, depending on what you choose. There are other associated costs such as apostilles,  translations, and a visa assistance service from local attorneys such as ours.

Here you will see an example of how much this can cost you.

## Benefits and restrictions

### **Up to one year validity**

This visa will be valid for up to one year.

### No **beneficiaries**

Since this visa is only for a specific, ongoing procedure, such as a criminal case, it doesn’t allow for beneficiaries.

### **No work permit**

Please notice that this type of visa does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since it doesn’t have a work permit. An exception is foreseen in the law in the events where the foreigner, in the context of a criminal case, is granted the posibility to commute its penalty with work.

### **No time accrue towards residency**

Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, this won’t allow you to add time in order to apply for a residency or (R) visa.

Submit a written communication from the applicant providing their full identification and explaining the activity that the foreigner intends to carry out in the national territory (details, participants, duration, schedule, location, among other aspects).

### 2. Sponsorship or invitation Letter

The request should also specify the type of relationship or bond with the foreigner and the sponsor's financial responsibility for the expenses related to the foreigner's travel and stay in the national territory. In this request, the sponsor must also register the information of other foreign citizens they have sponsored and commit to ensuring the foreigner's return to their country of origin or to report if the foreigner remains irregular in the national territory.

### 3. Proof of economic solvency of the applicant and/or sponsor

## Who can apply for this visa?

This visa allows its holder to perform seasonal agricultural tasks under programs established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, or by the Regional Government authorities  in coordination with the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. These programs will specify the estimated available quotas and the specific tasks that require labor support.

I have recently asked the Ministry of Agriculture about said programs and they told me there are no current available programs, but maybe on an specific Gobernación they might have something available.

The specific requirements for a medical treatment visa may vary depending on your sponsorship. If you are applying **with the sponsorship of a Colombian host**, you will need to provide documentation of your sponsor's financial solvency and the sponsor’s motivational letter. If you are applying **on your own behalf**, you will need to provide documentation of your own financial solvency and a motivational letter.

### **On your own behalf**

**Motivational letter**

You will need to write a motivational letter informing your full identification (full legal name, passport number, birthdate, nationality and residency), explaining thoroughly and accurately the activities that you are planning to do under the tourism visa, including the address of where you will be staying (such as an hotel, hostal, etc), itinerary, participants, and any other relevant information that can give the authorities where can you be found, what will you be doing and with who.

*(As of 2023, the minimum wage in Colombia is $1.160.000 per month)*

### Sponsored by a **Colombian host**

You can get your visa application sponsored or backed up by a Colombian national or Colombian resident (a foreigner with a current valid Resident visa), if this is the case, you will need:

**Letter from your sponsor**

### SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### 4. Letter from the doctor

Letter from the healthcare provider informing the type of treatment and the estimated duration of the recovery phase.

### 5. Motivation letter

Letter from the foreigner stating that the costs of their treatment and stay in Colombia will be covered by themselves or by the foreign entity supporting them, and under no circumstances will it generate expenses for the Colombian healthcare system.

### 5. A valid **health insurance**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

There are different options to comply with this requirement. Some of the (cheapests) health insurance providers that have the required coverage include: Genki, Terrawind, Mok, Travel Assist, Qualitas assistance and Travelkit.

Your health insurance should cover you for at least one year. According to our experience, the visa authorities are setting the validity of the digital nomad visa based on the coverage period of the health insurance policy. Therefore, we recommend that you obtain a two-year policy if you want your visa to be valid for two years.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/) (although we have no affiliation with them). Genki has the required coverage plus: 1) has 2 years validity by default. 2) Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month. 3) Can be cancelled anytime 4) The purchase is quick and online (one business day at the most) 5) They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in engligh, german, italian…) 6) has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

## Costs

The total costs vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the applicant. For example, if you have not bought your healht insurance and need to buy one for your visa application, that can be costly, depending on what you choose. There are other associated costs such as apostilles,  translations, and a visa assistance service from local attorneys such as ours.

Here you will see an example of how much this can cost you.

## Who can apply for this visa category?

This visa allows its holder to work in the exercise of religious ministry or to serve as a missionary of a religious entity duly recognized by the Colombian State.

It means that in order to work in a religious ministry or to serve as a missionary in Colombia, one must be affiliated with a religious organization that is officially recognized by the Colombian government. This recognition ensures that the individual is authorized to carry out their religious duties and activities within the country.

Remember that the main religion in Colombia is Roman-Catholic, if you are applying under a different church, you need to make sure that this church is officially recognized by the Colombian government. [Here you will find the list](https://www.mininterior.gov.co/registro-publico-de-entidades-religiosas/) of the almost 10,000 churches recognized by the Colombian Government:

The process of obtaining recognition for a religious organization in Colombia typically involves meeting certain legal requirements and going through an application process with the Colombian government. The specific steps and requirements may vary, but generally, the organization would need to submit documentation and information to demonstrate its legitimacy, structure, purpose, and activities.

MISSION AND VISION

<!-- Paragraph / big -->
We want to help expats, nomads and travelers with their immigration processes in Colombia because we know what it means to be playing away from home.

Ultimately, we want enrich Colombia through cultural exchange, because culture gets only richer with expats, foreigners, travelers, and nomads. 
We welcome gringos! We understand cultural differences and language barriers can slower down some [already slow] legal processes.

It was a difficult process, not because of Capital M, but with changes in the government and specific documentation needed for my individual case. I was incredibly impressed with the timeliness of Capital M in getting things done, staying on top of the process, and ultimately, after many different submissions, we finally made it happen and I was approved based on their persistance and guidance. I am so grateful for their patience in helping me get my visa. They also never charged me for all the additional work they did that was seemingly out of scope. They are great people.",

Daniel (excellent English) and his talented, hardworking team picked up the ball last minute from two prior legal services (one popular one which gave bad/incorrect advice, the other who didn't respond w/the urgency my case needed), and delivered the right visa solution for me. I am ecstatic. He was on top of everything, including facilitating a salvaconducto and subsequent  processing. I am amazed at their efficiency and accuracy, as well as their affordability. Choose them for your Colombian visa needs!",

The Retirement Visa requirements are straightforward, but there‚Äôs a great deal of detail and timelines to be met.\nDaniel Luque and Capital M Law tracked everything keeping me informed with timely email and a continuously upreviewDated spreadsheet in the most professional and respectful manner. They directed me to their many resources and contacts on how and where to gather the documents I needed, including translation and apostille services. AND communication was in English, since I haven‚Äôt learned Spanish yet. Capital M Law was a pleasure to work with.\nI started the process in the US about three months before arriving in Colombia and completed in about three months after that. My application was rejected the first time so we met and Capital M Law proposed a solution. We reapplied and it was approved the second time.\nThe fee Capital M Law charged was very reasonable.\nI couldn‚Äôt imagine doing this without a top-notch law team like Capital M Law.\nDavid",
